# Lesson 1
- Water with table salt dissolved in it boils at a higher temperature and freezes at a lower temperature than pure water.
# Lesson 2
- When a bouncy ball collides with an object far heavier than it, it bounces back with the same speed.
- e.g. A train goes right with 100Km/h, and a ball goes left with 50Km/h.
- In the perspective of the person in tht train, the ball came with 150Km/h and bounces back with 150Km/h.
- In the perspective of the person at ground, the ball bounces with 250Km/h.
# Lesson 3
- If a joint is connected with two beams to two, different joints in a rigid structure, then it's part of the rigid structure.
