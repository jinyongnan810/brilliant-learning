# Heat
- Water with table salt dissolved in it boils at a higher temperature and freezes at a lower temperature than pure water.
- Consider a cup of water in the pot with boiling water. The water in the cup will not be boiled, for its surroundings never go beyond 100 deg.
- Heat flows with much higher speed when the temperature gap is bigger.

# Collisions
- When a bouncy ball collides with an object far heavier than it, it bounces back with the same speed.
- e.g. A train goes right with 100Km/h, and a ball goes left with 50Km/h.
- In the perspective of the person in tht train, the ball came with 150Km/h and bounces back with 150Km/h.
- In the perspective of the person at ground, the ball bounces with 250Km/h.
# Rigid structure
- If a joint is connected with two beams to two, different joints in a rigid structure, then it's part of the rigid structure.

# Thermal expansion
- An object made of a single material expands in all directions when it's heated. Distance between any two points on the surface will increase. But the shape of the object will not change.
  - e.g. When a metal plate with a hole in it is heated, the hole will increase.
  - e.g. When a ring with a gap is heated, the shape is kept, so the gap will increase with the rest of the shape.
- Coefficient of thermal expansion describes how much a substance expands when its temperature increase.
  - A glass jar with an wooden lid will be easily opened when cooled. because CoTE of glass is larger than wood. Meaning glass will shrink and expand more when temperature changes.
