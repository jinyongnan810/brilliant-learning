# Heat
- Water with table salt dissolved in it boils at a higher temperature and freezes at a lower temperature than pure water.
- Consider a cup of water in the pot with boiling water. The water in the cup will not be boiled, for its surroundings never go beyond 100 deg.
- Heat flows with much higher speed when the temperature gap is bigger.

# Collisions
- When a bouncy ball collides with an object far heavier than it, it bounces back with the same speed.
- e.g. A train goes right with 100Km/h, and a ball goes left with 50Km/h.
- In the perspective of the person in tht train, the ball came with 150Km/h and bounces back with 150Km/h.
- In the perspective of the person at ground, the ball bounces with 250Km/h.
# Rigid structure
- If a joint is connected with two beams to two, different joints in a rigid structure, then it's part of the rigid structure.

# Thermal expansion
- An object made of a single material expands in all directions when it's heated. Distance between any two points on the surface will increase. But the shape of the object will not change.
  - e.g. When a metal plate with a hole in it is heated, the hole will increase.
  - e.g. When a ring with a gap is heated, the shape is kept, so the gap will increase with the rest of the shape.
- Coefficient of thermal expansion describes how much a substance expands when its temperature increase.
  - A glass jar with an wooden lid will be easily opened when cooled. because CoTE of glass is larger than wood. Meaning glass will shrink and expand more when temperature changes.

# Pressure
- Unlike forces, pressures does not point in any direction.
- Water maintain volume as it flows. Which means water flowing from thick pipe to narrow pipe will speed up.
- Water slows down when going to higher pressure, and speed up going to lower pressure. Therefore water in the thick pipe has higher pressure than the narrow pipe.

# Buoyancy
- Buoyancy came from pressure difference between depth of water.
- When drawing any imaginary boundary in a pool of water, the block of water's force is balanced. Which means is gravity equals is buoyancy. Which means the easiest way to calculate buoyancy is to check the amount of space the object takes and calculate its mess.

# Light
- Fermat's principle: The path light takes between two points is the path that takes the least time.
- Our eyes can’t see the polarization of light — whether the light wave is vertical, horizontal, or oscillating in some other direction, it looks the same to us.
- Any polarization of light can be treat as a superposition of some other lights with different polarizations.

# Circuits
- Voltage drop is in proportional to the resistance of the components in line.
- When there are more paths for the current to flow, the resistance goes down and the total current goes up.

# Relativity and Simultaneity
- Sound speed does not related to the speed of its source. When a car at 100m/s hear a sound from the behind, the sound will seem to travel at 330-100=230m/s to the people in car.
- The speed of light is the same for all observers. Some events may seam happened simultaneously to some observer, but different in any degrees to some other observers.
