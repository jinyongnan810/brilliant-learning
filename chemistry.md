# Chemical Reactions
- Reactions starts with reactant and end with products.
- When the speed of forward and reverse reactions are equal, then the system has attained chemical equilibrium.
- Le Chatelier's principle: remove products of reaction to lean towards only one direction of reaction, which avoids reaching equilibrium.
