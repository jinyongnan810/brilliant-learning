# Vocabulary
- molecule: a single unit
- Glucose: C6H12O6
- Na: sodium
- Cl: chlorine
- combustion: some substance reacts with oxygen and produce CO2 & H2O
- octane: C8H18 component of gasoline. Also implies anything that can produce great power
- chemical volcano: NaHCO3(baking soda) + CH3CO2H(vinegar, aka acetic acid) = CH3CO2Na + CO2 + H2O
- acid dissociation constant(Ka): equilibrium constants Keq for acids. An acid's Ka >= 10^-2 is considered strong.(HCl: 10^8, HBr: 10^9)
  - pKa: -logKa (HCl: -8, vinegar: 5)
- 


# Chemical Reactions
- Reactions starts with reactant and end with products.
- When the speed of forward and reverse reactions are equal, then the system has attained chemical equilibrium.
- Le Chatelier's principle: remove products of reaction to lean towards only one direction of reaction, which avoids reaching equilibrium.

# Important Reactions
- photosynthesis: 6CO2 + 6H2O = C6H12O6 + 6O2
- cellular respiration: C6H12O6 + 6O2 = 6CO2 + 6H2O
