# Quantum Mechanics
## Wave-Particle Duality
### Interference
- Electromagnetic waves obey the principle of superposition.
- When 2 same light with offset of half the wave length meet, they cancel each other out. Which is called destructive interference.

### Double Slit Experiment

- This experiment shows that light is a wave.

### Double Slit Experiment with Single Photon

- shows that individual photon can interfere with itself.
