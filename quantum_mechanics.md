# Quantum Mechanics
## Wave-Particle Duality
### Interference
- Electromagnetic waves obey the principle of superposition.
- When 2 same light with offset of half the wave length meet, they cancel each other out. Which is called destructive interference.

### Double Slit Experiment

- This experiment shows that light is a wave.

### Double Slit Experiment with Single Photon
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzbKb59my3U
- shows that individual photon can interfere with itself.

## Kets
- Kets, being vectors in a realm beyond tangible world called Hilbert space, describes the quantum state of particles.
- Example:
  - we have a 45 degree polarized lens, and a photon has ket of |90degrees> aka |V>.
  - the photon's ket of |V> ~ |45deg> + |135deg>
  - when the photon goes through the lens, its state collapses to |45deg>

## Entanglement
- Quantum state has 4 quantum numbers: n, l, m, s.
  - if 2 particles are generated, interact, or share spatial proximity, they can get entangled.
  - entangled particles depend on each other's quantum state.
  - the states of two unrelated particles are called product states, while the states of entangled particles are called entangled state aka Bell's state.
