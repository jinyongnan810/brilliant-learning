# Toilets

- Siphon Effect: a tube is full of liquids with no air gaps, then the hydrostatic pressure from high end will drive liquids to the lower end. A Siphon does not only levels the water, but will transport all the water to the lower side, then it will break because air leaks in.
- When we flush the toilets, the bowl of the toilet and the sewer pipe will form a siphon. The siphon transfers all the contents of the bowl to sewer, then it breaks.

# Water Towers
- Pressure = Force/Area (1Pa = 1N/m^2)
- ΔP=ρgΔh (which means 1m deeper the water, 10kPa pressure increases)
- The pressure of the tap water at home, depends only on the height difference. Which means being far away from the water tower does not decrease the pressure.

# Refrigerators
- Compressor pump: compressing gas makes the gas warmer.
  - Because adding pressure increases gas molecules's energy.
- Expansion valve: expanding gas makes the gas colder.
  - When gas expanding, it energy decreases for pushing things away.
- Radiator: balancing the temperature with surrounding environment.

# Throwing Axe
- angular velocity w = v / l
- w does not change before and after throwing
- 1 rotation takes T = 2Pi / w
- 1 rotation makes distance D = T * v = (2Pi / w) * (w * l) = 2Pi * l
- Which means however we throw an axe, the distance it travels one loop is only depended on the length(arm+axe).

# BMX
- Torque: twisting force on an object about a pivot point
  - T = F * R
- Angular momentum: measure of how much an object is spinning
  - L = m * v * R
  - L won't be changed without outside influence.
  - During spinning, if R is reduced, v will be increased.
  - Flipping bikes
    - forwards: hit the brake.
      - L in the wheels will transform to bike to help it spin forwards.
    - backwards: hit the gas.
      - L in the wheels go up, making an force to make it spin backwards.(not fully understand)

# Skiing
- Net Force: the accumulation of all forces.
- normal force: the right angle force.
- Air Drag: resistance of the air.
  - Fair = 1/2 * C * A * v^2 (C is coefficient that calculated in that particular air, A is area)

# Gymnastics
- kinetic energy K: moving energy, calculated by K = 0.5 * m * v^2

# Baseball
- momentum: p = m * v
- F(average) = delta p / delta t

# Fossil fuels
- C6H12O6 -> 1 million years -> 3CH4 + 3CO2
- 1L gasoline makes 4*10^7 J energy.
  - 1J = 1N * 1m
  - 1Kwh = 3.6 * 10^6 J -> 1ws = 1J
  - 1calorie = 4.184J (1calorie = energy needed to raise 1g of water raise 1C) 
- Solar energy arrive at earth's surface is about 1360J/m^2
  - 1m^2 light fully absorbed for 1 hour gets about 1.36Kwh

# Mammalian Caloric Intake
- Blackbody radiation: as long as an object is not at 0 temperature, it will always radiate heat from its surface in the form of infrared photons.
  - rate of BR is proportional to SA * T^4(SA: surface area, T: temperature)
- Mammals' T is almost the same. BR ~ SA ~ V^(2/3) ~ M^(2/3)
  - if loss of mass due to BR is the about the same as the intake mass. 
  - then fraction of intake mass to the body mass is about M^(2/3) / M = M^(-1/3)

# Nuclear Energy
- Atom's mass A = Z(number of protons) + N(number of neutrons)
- The constitution of a nucleus of X is represented by: $_Z^AX$
- In the nucleus, while protons has electrostatic repulsion to push them apart, the Strong Nuclear Force that attracts all the nucleons(both protons and neutrons) keeps the nucleus intact.
  - Nuclear force is short-ranged and acts between pairs of neighboring nucleons, not across the nucleus.
- Binding energy: The force needed to break apart an nucleus.
- Helium-4 atom's mass is less than the mass of 2 protons and 2 neutrons.
  - Which means some of the mass converts to energy and released when forming a stable nucleus.
  - The difference in mass is called mass defect
  - Binding energy is equal to the energy of mass defect.
  - Nucleus's stability is related to $(binding energy) \over (Z+N)$
- Fusion sample: $_1^2H + _1^3H = _2^4H + _0^1n$ ($_1^2H$: deuterium, $_1^3H$: tritium)
- Fission sample: $_{92}^{235}U +_0^1n \to _{92}^{236}U(unstable) \to _{56}^{141}Ba + _{36}^{92}Kr + 3_0^1n + Q$
  - neutrons of the product may be used to trigger another reaction
  - controlled fission uses tools such as cadmium rod to absorb excess neutrons.
