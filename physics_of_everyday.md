# Toilets

- Siphon Effect: a tube is full of liquids with no air gaps, then the hydrostatic pressure from high end will drive liquids to the lower end. A Siphon does not only levels the water, but will transport all the water to the lower side, then it will break because air leaks in.
- When we flush the toilets, the bowl of the toilet and the sewer pipe will form a siphon. The siphon transfers all the contents of the bowl to sewer, then it breaks.
