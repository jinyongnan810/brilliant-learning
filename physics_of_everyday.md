# Toilets

- Siphon Effect: a tube is full of liquids with no air gaps, then the hydrostatic pressure from high end will drive liquids to the lower end. A Siphon does not only levels the water, but will transport all the water to the lower side, then it will break because air leaks in.
- When we flush the toilets, the bowl of the toilet and the sewer pipe will form a siphon. The siphon transfers all the contents of the bowl to sewer, then it breaks.

# Water Towers
- Pressure = Force/Area (1Pa = 1N/m^2)
- ΔP=ρgΔh (which means 1m deeper the water, 10kPa pressure increases)
- The pressure of the tap water at home, depends only on the height difference. Which means being far away from the water tower does not decrease the pressure.

# Refrigerators
- Compressor pump: compressing gas makes the gas warmer.
  - Because adding pressure increases gas molecules's energy.
- Expansion valve: expanding gas makes the gas colder.
  - When gas expanding, it energy decreases for pushing things away.
- Radiator: balancing the temperature with surrounding environment.

# Throwing Axe
- angular velocity w = v / l
- w does not change before and after throwing
- 1 rotation takes T = 2Pi / w
- 1 rotation makes distance D = T * v = (2Pi / w) * (w * l) = 2Pi * l
- Which means however we throw an axe, the distance it travels one loop is only depended on the length(arm+axe).

# BMX
- Torque: twisting force on an object about a pivot point
  - T = F * R
- Angular momentum: measure of how much an object is spinning
  - L = m * v * R
  - L won't be changed without outside influence.
  - During spinning, if R is reduced, v will be increased.
  - Flipping bikes
    - forwards: hit the brake.
      - L in the wheels will transform to bike to help it spin forwards.
    - backwards: hit the gas.
      - L in the wheels go up, making an force to make it spin backwards.(not fully understand)
