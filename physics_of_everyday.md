# Toilets

- Siphon Effect: a tube is full of liquids with no air gaps, then the hydrostatic pressure from high end will drive liquids to the lower end. A Siphon does not only levels the water, but will transport all the water to the lower side, then it will break because air leaks in.
- When we flush the toilets, the bowl of the toilet and the sewer pipe will form a siphon. The siphon transfers all the contents of the bowl to sewer, then it breaks.

# Water Towers
- Pressure = Force/Area (1Pa = 1N/m^2)
- ΔP=ρgΔh (which means 1m deeper the water, 10kPa pressure increases)
- The pressure of the tap water at home, depends only on the height difference. Which means being far away from the water tower does not decrease the pressure.
