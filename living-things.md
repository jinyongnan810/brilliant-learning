# Insects
- Insects don't have lungs, and breath through tiny holes on their body called spiracles.
  - One of the reason the insects don't get big than 40cm is that, the bigger it gets, the ratio between surface and body size become larger, which makes it harder to deliver enough oxygen to whole body.

# Giant Animals
- Physic limits of getting bigger and bigger
  - If an animal is scaled up 10x in each dimension, the weight will scale up about 1000x.
    - Meanwhile the cross-section of its bones only expand to 100x, which provide only 100x capability to support weight.
  - Food supply.
- Giant animals has hight mass/surface ratio, which brings merits of
  - toughness to endure temperature change
  - toughness to keep water
  - toughness to endure hanger
  - low metabolism and longer lifespan
- Due to their stubbornness to environment, the ultimate demerit appears, that they replace generations very slow, and they barely improve themselves. Which makes extinction unavoidable.
