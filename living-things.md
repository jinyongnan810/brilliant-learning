# Insects
- Insects don't have lungs, and breath through tiny holes on their body called spiracles.
  - One of the reason the insects don't get big than 40cm is that, the bigger it gets, the ratio between surface and body size become larger, which makes it harder to deliver enough oxygen to whole body.
